### Hi there 👋🏾👋🏽👋🏽

My name is Ezike Tobenna. I'm an Android Engineer at Softcom, currently working on Eyowo - an app that provides reliable financial services to anyone with a phone number. 

I enjoy developing for Android 🤖, and I think my favorite thing to talk about is app architecture. 

Thanks for checking out my profile.
