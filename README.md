### Hi there 👋🏾👋🏽👋🏽

My name is Ezike Tobenna. I'm an Android Engineer at [Softcom](https://softcom.ng), currently working on [Eyowo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eyowo.android) - an app that provides reliable financial services to anyone with a phone number. 

I enjoy developing for Android 🤖, and I think my favorite thing to talk about is software architecture. 

Thanks for checking out my profile.

You can connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/T0bey_), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/misterr_tee/), or even [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobenna-ezike/).
(Share your cat pictures with me 😺😺😺)
